Background:: 
* I have been running `gem install` on this machine frequently without issues. 
* I had `xcode` already installed.
* I recently **installed an macOS update on the machine**

== Root cause
A quick Google search revealed that macOS updates could break the previosely installed `xcode`. 

== The Fix
There are 3 options to fix the issue and try in oder if the issue still exist after each action.

. Re-install `xcode`
[source, bash]
$ xcode-select --install

. Force reset `xcode` with `sudo`
[source, bash]
$ sudo xcode-select --reset
    
. Manually download `xcode` from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Apple developer]
