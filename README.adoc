I am using JetBrains products (IntlliJ, WebStorm, etc). With IntelliJ you can access:

'IntelliJ IDEA/ WebStorm -> Preferences -> Plugins -> search for AsciiDoc and install the plugin -> udnder Preferences -> Langauages & Frameworks -> AsciiDoc - Check the box that says "Use Kroki to render diagrams instead of AsciiDoctor Diagram" -> Point to your own server or local docker endpoint, which may have setup following the above setup guide - http://localhost:8080`
