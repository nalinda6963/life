# 3D Printing - Software Setup Guide
This document will provide the basic guidance on setting up a new machine to use for 3d printing related activities.

## Cura
Cura is a free slicing software. Besides the fact this is free, Cura is one of the best slicing software options in the industry. It is necessary to have the right profile, matching your printer, loaded to get the best printing experience. The latest version of cura can be downloaded from [here](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).

## Printer Profile
This the most important factor to have a nice and clean print. Please refer to the printer profile directory to pick the right profile for your printer (these are the profiles either I personally created, edited or downloaded from user forums).
